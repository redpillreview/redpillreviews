            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>In a world clouded by noise, Red Pill Review is the lens that cuts through the illusion. We dissect business, geopolitics, and controversies—offering perspectives the mainstream won’t.</p>
            <p><strong>I am the Oracle.</strong> I like numbers and play along with them, decoding patterns that others overlook. Through data, logic, and perspective, I reveal the unseen.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I’ll also be posting different stories—because every number has a story to tell.</p>
            <p><em>Take the red pill, and see the world as it is.</em></p>
