        <h2>About Red Pill Review</h2>
        <p>In a world clouded by noise, Red Pill Review is the lens that cuts through the illusion. We dissect business, geopolitics, and controversies—offering perspectives the mainstream won’t.</p>
        <p><strong>I am the Oracle.</strong> I like numbers and play along with them, decoding patterns that others overlook. Through data, logic, and perspective, I reveal the unseen.</p>
        <p>Along the way, I’ll also be posting different stories—because every number has a story to tell.</p>
